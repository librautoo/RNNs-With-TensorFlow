# Recurrent Neural Network with TensorFlow

This project is an implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow, inspired by the original project created by [kanncaa1 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kanncaa1/recurrent-neural-network-with-pytorch), which uses PyTorch. The primary goal of this project is to rewrite the original PyTorch code in TensorFlow, providing a similar functionality while leveraging TensorFlow's features and ecosystem.
